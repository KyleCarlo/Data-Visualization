ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Variable description	Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated by Our World in Data based on emissions data from Jones et al. (2023) and IPCC AR6 conversion factors. Jones et al. (2023) give methane and nitrous oxide emissions in standard metric tonnes per year. We have converted these emissions to carbon-dioxide equivalents over a 100-year timescale using a conversion factor of 273 for nitrous oxide, 29.8 for methane from fossil sources, and 27.2 for methane from agricultural and land use sources (as per the IPCC AR6 report).
Variable time span	1851 – 2021

Jones et al. (2023) quantify national and regional contributions to the increase of global mean surface temperature over the last few centuries. As they detail: the "dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources during 1851-2021.

National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et al., 2022).

National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (Gütschow et al., 2022).

We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).

Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST)."
