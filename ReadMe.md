            Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated by Our World in Data based on emissions data from Jones et al. (2023) and IPCC AR6 conversion factors. Jones et al. (2023) give methane and nitrous oxide emissions in standard metric tonnes per year. We have converted these emissions to carbon-dioxide equivalents over a 100-year timescale using a conversion factor of 273 for nitrous oxide, 29.8 for methane from fossil sources, and 27.2 for methane from agricultural and land use sources (as per the IPCC AR6 report).

Jones et al. (2023) quantify national and regional contributions to the increase of global mean surface temperature over the last few centuries. As they detail: the "dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources during 1851-2021.

National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et al., 2022).

National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (Gütschow et al., 2022).

We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).

Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST)."

            We use two similar but distinct methodologies to produce displacement estimates related to conflict and violence, and disasters. In the case of conflict- and violence-induced displacement, we conduct situational monitoring in certain countries after we learn of the occurrence of displacement, and report the country-wide estimates of new displacement during the year and the total number of people displaced at year’s end. In contrast, we monitor and report cases of disaster-induced displacement on an event-by-event basis. For each of these events, we collect information from different sources and generate the most comprehensive and reliable displacement estimate for that disaster.
            <br/><br/>
            We rely on an extensive range of data sources including: national and subnational government authorities, UN agencies and other international organisations, related global databases, civil society organisations, news media outlets, and other entities.

            The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis version 4 (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change. Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas), combined as described in our publications Hansen et al. (2010) and Lenssen et al. (2019). These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports and corrections for earlier months.

<p>
    The basic GISS temperature analysis scheme was defined in the late 1970s by James Hansen when a method of estimating global temperature change was needed for comparison with one-dimensional global climate models. The analysis method was fully documented in Hansen and Lebedeff (1987). Several papers describing updates to the analysis followed over the following decades, most recently that of Hansen et al. (2010), as well as the uncertainty quantification of Lenssen et al. (2019).
